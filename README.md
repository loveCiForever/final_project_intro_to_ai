# Final Project — Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains our final project for the course *503043 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence*, developed by a team of second-year students. The project includes implementations of four AI-related tasks using various algorithms and approaches.

## Project Overview

1. **Simulated Annealing Search on 3D Surfaces**  
   Optimization of complex surfaces using the Simulated Annealing technique to avoid local minima and converge toward global optima.

2. **9x9 Tic-Tac-Toe with Heuristic Alpha-Beta Search**  
   An extended Tic-Tac-Toe game where the AI uses alpha-beta pruning with heuristics for optimal move selection in a large 9x9 board.

3. **Constraint Satisfaction Problems with Propositional Logic**  
   Solving CSPs by encoding them into propositional logic formulas and applying logical inference techniques.

4. **Naïve Bayesian Classifier**  
   A machine learning approach to classification using the Naïve Bayes algorithm, suitable for text or structured data.
